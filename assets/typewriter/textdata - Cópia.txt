-The lonely coder (by Tiago Silva)
There was a coder, that really liked to code. One day while 
looking at his monitor he decided, "that's it, I really need 
to touch some grass", he stood up, opened his door and to his 
surprise, there was nothing outside. He closed his eyes and 
opened them again, only to see a white void of despair with 
nothing around him. So he took three steps forward, and out 
of a sudden, he sees something! IT'S LIGHT! HE CAN SEE 
LIGHT! He recognizes this weird thing that appears to have 
some weird green things coming out from it, he wonders if 
this is "grass". So as he was about to touch it, he died of fear.

-Robot and ladybug (by Tiago Silva)
There was a robot, a very innocent robot that liked to fly
high. One day, he found a ladybug, to the eyes of everyone
else there was just an insect, but the robot saw something,
something special in between all the others that made that
one stand out, but never really knew why. All the time, the
robot thought highly of that ladybug and sometimes the robot
would do stupid things just to try and get the ladybug to
like him. But, poor robot, who spent so much time studying,
never actually took the time to learn about ladybugs.

-Arclight (by Arcayn)
Arclight is an ecosystem intended to help developers in 
creating new C++ projects quickly without having to setup 
a common codebase everytime. It offers a wide range of 
features, ranging from basic utilities over image 
manipulation up to 3D rendering. Additionally, all code 
is written in C++20 by making heavy use of new concepts 
introduced in later C++ standards. No code cruft, no old 
libraries from over 20 years, no license confusion: Arclight 
unifies all aspects of application development into 
one toolbox.
